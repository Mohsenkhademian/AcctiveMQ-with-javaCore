Implement basic ActiveMQ setup with message sending and receiving

* Important Notice for Running the Main Method in ActiveMQ:

Before running the Main method, make sure to start the ActiveMQ broker by executing the activemq.bat file located in the win64 folder inside the bin directory. Only after starting the broker should you proceed to execute the Main method.

This is crucial as the Main method relies on an active ActiveMQ broker to send and receive messages properly.
